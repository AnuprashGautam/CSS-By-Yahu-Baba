Alright! Let‚Äôs walk through this code together in a very simple way:

---

### 1. **HTML Part**
- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Tells the browser this is an HTML5 document.
- `<html lang="en">`: Starts the HTML document, in English.
- `<head>`: Contains page information like title, styles, etc.
- `<title>Align Form with Flexbox</title>`: The tab title will show "Align Form with Flexbox".
- `<style>`: CSS is written directly inside the page (internal CSS).

**Inside `<body>`:**
- A heading: `<h1>Form</h1>`
- A form: `<form>` with a list `<ul id="wrapper">`.
- The form has:
  - Three list items `<li>` with a `<label>` and `<input>` for Name, Class Name, and Email Address.
  - One `<li>` with a **Save** button.

---

### 2. **CSS Part (Styling)**

- **h1 styling**
  - `margin-left: 50px;`: Push the heading slightly to the right.

- **#wrapper (the form container)**
  - `margin: 50px;`: Adds space around the wrapper.
  - `padding: 20px;`: Adds space *inside* the wrapper.
  - `background-color: #eee;`: Light gray background.

- **#wrapper li (each form row)**
  - `display: flex;`: Makes each `<li>` behave like a flex container.
  - `padding: 5px 0;`: Adds vertical space between each input row.
  - `justify-content: flex-end;`: Pushes content toward the right.

- **#wrapper li label**
  - `flex: 1;`: Label takes up 1 portion of the space.

---

### 3. **Responsive Design (Media Queries)**

The form adjusts its layout based on screen size:

| Screen Width              | What Happens                        |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 300px to 499px             | Inputs stack vertically (`flex-direction: column`), and input takes **3x** space. |
| 500px and above            | Inputs get **3x** space compared to label. |
| 768px and above            | Inputs get **4x** space compared to label. |
| 992px and above            | Inputs get **6x** space compared to label. |
| 1200px and above           | Inputs get **8x** space compared to label. |

‚ûî In simple words:  
On **small devices**, labels and inputs stack vertically.  
On **bigger devices**, they are side-by-side, and the input field becomes wider as the screen size increases.

### 4. **Key Idea Behind the Code**

‚úÖ Use **Flexbox** to neatly align labels and inputs.  
‚úÖ Make the form **responsive**, so it looks good on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
